    "## Section 3.4 - Climate Model Output\n",
    "\n",
    "Up until now, this chapter has focused on acquiring and analyzing climate data from observations, or reanalysis data which assimilates observational data into a weather forecast model. These sources of data are only half of the story. Since this guide is about climate change projections, we must also learn how to download and process output from climate model simulations. \n",
    "\n",
    "Output from climate models that was submitted to the CMIP projects has been made publicly available for download from the [Earth System Grid Federation (ESGF)](https://esgf.llnl.gov/). The ESGF is a peer-to-peer network with nodes hosted by several research centres around the world. The archive of data hosted on a given node can be searched and naviagted in a browser. The website for the node hosted at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory in the USA can be found [at this link](https://esgf-node.llnl.gov/projects/esgf-llnl/), and links for all of the nodes can be found [here](https://esgf.llnl.gov/nodes.html). Via the browser interface, one can populate their data cart like an online store and generate a `wget` script that when executed, will download the selected data. However, this process can be somewhat cumbersome if you are interested in large amounts of data, or if you wish to create an automated workflow. For advanced users, the ESGF offers a RESTful API, which is outside the scope of this guide. In this guide we will use the Python package ([esgf-pyclient](https://esgf-pyclient.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)) (also called `pyesgf`) as an interface to the API. With `pyesgf`, one can either get an OPeNDAP URL to access the data directly, or get a URL from which the data can be downloaded using the Python `requests` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Complete documentation for the ESGF, and all options for accessing the data, can be found here].(https://esgf.github.io/esgf-user-support/index.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As with the reanalysis and gridded observations, climate model output is typically very large in volume. For this reason, we will show examples in this notebook using monthly means instead of daily means or 6-hourly instananeous output, which is typically required for climate impact analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Searching For Data\n",
    "To search the ESGF archive we must first establish a connection to an ESGF node using the `pyesgf.search.SearchConnection` class. To do this, we pass the URL for the node to `SearchConnection`. Since each node may only host a subset of the complete CMIP archive, the argument `distrib = True` tells the API to search across all nodes, not just the one we connected to."
