# Section 3: Exploring Climate Data

Observational data is a critical part of the downscaling and climate impact analysis workflow. Before you can even start to consider how climate change will affect a certain climate indicator related to your study domain, you need to understand what this metric looks like in the climate of the present and recent past. This includes things like the **seasonal cycle** - how the indicator (and/or climate variables used to calculate it) typically varies throughout the year -  which we quantify using a **climatology** (also called **climate normal**). This is usually calculated using long-term (30-year) averages for each month, season, or day of the year, with a range of typical values, usually quantified using the one standard deviation range about the mean. Depending on your application, you may also be interested in **extreme values** of a climate variable or indicator - values which fall outside the typical range of variability. Of course, we also need observations to use in the bias-adjustment step of downscaling (more on that in Section 4), so there are many reasons why it's important to learn how to acquire and analyze observational data.
