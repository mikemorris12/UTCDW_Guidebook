# Summary

The University of Toronto Climate Downscaling Workflow (UTCDW) is a resource designed to teach users how to produce their own statistically downscaled climate projections for the purpose of climate change impact analysis. The target audience is graduate students or practitioners who may work outside the field of climate science, but are interested in how their subject of study is sensitive to climate change. The main component of the UTCDW is a [Jupyter Book](https://utcdw.physics.utoronto.ca/UTCDW_Guidebook/README.html) that introduces users to fundamental topics of climate science and downscaling, and unpacks the decisions that must be made when designing a climate change impact study. The guidebook demonstrates how to download climate data, do exploratory analysis, and model validation. It also provides examples of end-to-end workflows for small climate downscaling projects. The examples implement both bias-adjustment of one-dimensional time series representing data for a single location, and gridded downscaling methods to enhance the spatial resolution of model projections over an extended region. For users who do not wish to use pre-processed downscaled data, the guidebook also shows users how to access ready-to-use downscaled model output for Canada from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium (citation) and links to other publicly available downscaled data products for additional regions or the globe. The UTCDW also includes a [website](https://utcdw.physics.utoronto.ca/) that contains a guided survey that helps a user design their climate impact study and generated a flowchart image that lays out the steps for the workflow.
