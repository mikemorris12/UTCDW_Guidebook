# Chapter 5: Downscaling Workflow

In the previous chapters, you've been introduced to the requisite background climate science and technical knowledge necessary for starting to work on a climate downscaling project. In this chapter, we'll put all of this knowledge together, and explicitly lay out the various decisions one needs to make when planning a climate change impact analysis study. In other words, this chapter will be about the "W" in UTCDW - here we will develop a generic **workflow** for downscaling.

|*Generic Downscaling Workflow*|

This flowchart includes each of the decisions and analysis steps required to produce calibrated projectections of a climate indicator/index relevant for your domain application (engineering related or otherwise). Each section of this chapter will go through a different decision in detail, explain the factors you'll need to consider, and provide guidance on best practices. Nearly all of the content will connect with information from previous chapters, so if something seems new and unfamiliar, return to the earlier part of this book and you'll likely find what you need to continue with confident understanding.

**Reinventing the Wheel**

The flowchart for the complete workflow assumes you are interested in produced your own statistically downscaled climate data, for use in your climate impact study. As you work through the first several steps, you may find that this isn't necessary, if downscaled projections of the variables needed to calculate your climate indicators (see Section 5.1) are already available. In Sections 4.4 and 4.5 we worked with downscaled climate data from the Pacific Climate Impacts Consortium ([PCIC](https://pacificclimate.org/data/statistically-downscaled-climate-scenarios)), which provides selected downscaled output from CMIP5 and CMIP6 models, with spatial coverage over Canada. Similar pre-produced downscaled climate data is available from other organizations such as [CarbonPlan](https://carbonplan.org/research/cmip6-downscaling-explainer), [NASA-NEX](https://www.nasa.gov/nex/gddp), and the [Climate Impact Lab](https://planetarycomputer.microsoft.com/dataset/group/cil-gdpcir). If any of these downscaled datasets (or others) suit your needs, it would be sensible to take advantage of them instead of going through the trouble of doing downscaling yourself. 

If you plan to use an existing downscaled data product, you should still continue reading the rest of this guidebook. As you can see in the workflow schematic, there is much more to a climate impact study than producing downscaled climate data, and many study design decisions need to be made regardless of whether you plan to do your own downscaling or not. The only steps you'll skip are "Choose and Fit Transfer Function" and "Apply Transfer Function". The significance of these steps are not to be diminished, they are indeed a critical part of the downscaling workflow, which is why using an existing downscaled data product that suits your needs can save you significant amount of time and effort. If no publicly available downscaled data meets the requirements of your study, then have no fear, for that's the primary purpose of this guidebook! The information in this chapter will help you carry out the downscaling process.
