# 3.5 Chapter Summary

This chapter has been about accessing, downloading, and exploratory analysis of different sources of climate data. These include:

* Station observations
* Gridded observations
* Reanalysis
* Climate model output

For a given climate impact study, you will need some or even all of these types of climate data. Additionally, the utility of the Python libraries `xarray` and `pandas` demonstrated in the examples herein will be key for the more comprehensive analysis involved in the future examples of downscaling methods, and for your own studies.
