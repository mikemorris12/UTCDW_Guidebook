# 5.4 Producing Downscaled Data

The next stage in the workflow is to use what you learned by exploring the observational and raw model data to select and apply your method for bias correcting and/or downscaling the model output to product calibrated projections of your required climate variables.

## 5.4.1 Choosing a Bias Correction/Downscaling Method

The best bias correction and/or downscaling methods to use depend on both your spatial sampling requirements, and the results of your investigation of the model biases. If you require gridded data with high spatial resolution, using a true "downscaling" method, such as a constructed analogue based method, is necessary. However, if all you need is point data at one or more distinct spatial locations, then a 1D bias correction method is sufficient, and there isn't a need to produce output on a fine spatial grid. We reccommend Quantile Delta Mapping (QDM) because of its ability to adjust biases in all quantiles of the distribution of a quantity, while also preserving projected changes in extreme values ([Cannon et al, 2015](https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-14-00754.1)).

If you wish to use an analogue method such as DBCCA or BCCAQ for spatial downscaling, the nature of the model biases are important to consider. Good agreement between the raw model output and observations means that only minor bias adjustment is required, and it is likely that there are observed analogues that share similar qualities to the model days being downscaled. If this is the case, then proceed with your preferred analogue downscaling method. Here we reccommend DBCCA, because of its ease of implementation relative to BCCAQ, while retaining good performance (as per [Murdock et al. (2014)](https://www.pacificclimate.org/sites/default/files/publications/PCIC_EC_downscaling_report_2014.pdf) and  [Werner and Cannon (2016)](https://doi.org/10.5194/hess-20-1483-2016)). Code for the DBCCA method is included in Chapter 6, along with examples implementing it.

If the raw model data looks very different from the observations, in terms of probability distributions, spatial patterns, or historical trends, then analogue-based downscaling methods may not be appropriate. The lowest 30 RMSE patterns from the observations might not be good matches to the model pattern, so the downscaled data would not be reflective of the underlying model projections, which aren't even trustworthy in the first place. Clearly things are much more difficult in this case, and the multivariate downscaling methods that might be more acceptable are outside of the scope of this guide. Alternatively, high-resolution climate simulations such as RCM data from [CORDEX](https://cordex.org/) or global data from [HighResMIP](https://highresmip.org/) may provide better raw model output to use as the starting point for statistical downscaling, though you should still perform the same validation you would for coarse model data. If high resolution model data still shows very poor agreement with observations for one or more of your required variables, then you'll need to look outside this guide for additional guidance regarding best practices for downscaling these climate variables.
