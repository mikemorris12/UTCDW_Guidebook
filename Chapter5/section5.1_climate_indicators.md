# 5.1 Climate Indicators

If you're reading this guidebook, it's unlikely you're interested in doing downscaling for its own sake. Most users will be interested in using downscaled projections to study how a certain system which is sensitive to the climate (sometimes called an "exposure unit") might be affected by climate change. To do this, you'll fist need to define one or more quantities, which depend on climate variables as inputs, that measures the degree to which your exposure unit is vulnerable to the climate. These quantities are called **climate indiactors** or climate indices (singular: climate index), and are ultimately what you'll use for the application side of your study. 

If you're a user coming from outside of climate science, your climate indicator(s) should be what you're already an expert in. It can be the output of an inpact model that takes climate data as inputs, such as the Variable Infiltration Capacity Model in hydrology ([Liang et al., 1994](https://doi.org/10.1029/94JD00483)). It can also be much simpler, such as one of the many [ClimDEX standard climate indices](https://www.climdex.org/learn/indices/), each of which are calculated using elementary operations on a single climate variable (and have methods implemented to calculate them in the Python package [xclim](https://xclim.readthedocs.io/en/stable/indices.html)).
