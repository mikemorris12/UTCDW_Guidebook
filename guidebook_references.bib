	abstract = {A statistical downscaling algorithm is introduced to forecast surface wind speed at a location. The downscaling algorithm consists of resolved and unresolved components to yield a time series of synthetic wind speeds at high time resolution. The resolved component is a bias-corrected numerical weather prediction model forecast of the 10-m wind speed at the location. The unresolved component is a simulated time series of the high-frequency component of the wind speed that is trained to match the variance and power spectral density of wind observations at the location. Because of the stochastic nature of the unresolved wind speed, the downscaling algorithm may be repeated to yield an ensemble of synthetic wind speeds. The ensemble may be used to generate probabilistic predictions of the sustained wind speed or wind gusts. Veriﬁcation of the synthetic winds produced by the downscaling algorithm indicates that it can accurately predict various features of the observed wind, such as the probability distribution function of wind speeds, the power spectral density, daily maximum wind gust, and daily maximum sustained wind speed. Thus, the downscaling algorithm may be broadly applicable to any application that requires a computationally efﬁcient, accurate way of generating probabilistic forecasts of wind speed at various time averages or forecast horizons.},

	abstract = {Abstract While internal climate variability is known to affect climate projections, its influence is often underappreciated and confused with model error. Why? In general, modeling centers contribute a small number of realizations to international climate model assessments [e.g., phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5)]. As a result, model error and internal climate variability are difficult, and at times impossible, to disentangle. In response, the Community Earth System Model (CESM) community designed the CESM Large Ensemble (CESM-LE) with the explicit goal of enabling assessment of climate change in the presence of internal climate variability. All CESM-LE simulations use a single CMIP5 model (CESM with the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5). The core simulations replay the twenty to twenty-first century (1920–2100) 30 times under historical and representative concentration pathway 8.5 external forcing with small initial condition differences. Two companion 1000+-yr-long preindustrial control simulations (fully coupled, prognostic atmosphere and land only) allow assessment of internal climate variability in the absence of climate change. Comprehensive outputs, including many daily fields, are available as single-variable time series on the Earth System Grid for anyone to use. Early results demonstrate the substantial influence of internal climate variability on twentieth- to twenty-first-century climate trajectories. Global warming hiatus decades occur, similar to those recently observed. Internal climate variability alone can produce projection spread comparable to that in CMIP5. Scientists and stakeholders can use CESM-LE outputs to help interpret the observational record, to understand projection spread and to plan for a range of possible futures influenced by both internal climate variability and forced climate change.},

Regional temperature variability can therefore influence biodiesel adoption, with potential economic and environmental implications. This study assesses present and future biodiesel cold weather operability limits in North America according to temperature data from weather stations, atmospheric reanalysis, and global climate models with highest resolution over Ontario, Canada. Future temperature projections using the RCP8.5 climate change scenario show increases in the potential duration for certain seasonal fuel blends. For example, biodiesel blends whose cloud point temperature is −9 °C may expand their duration by 3–7\% in North America for nonwinter seasons according to projections for 2040. Cloud point specifications among supply orbits in Ontario increase up to +6 °C during nonwinter seasons, with most increases observed in Fall and Spring. In winter, however, the modeling suggests no change in Ontario cloud point specifications because the coldest temperatures by mid-century are not significantly warmer than the past climate normal according to our climate simulations. This study provides a quantitative analysis on biodiesel usage scenarios under a changing climate, including Ontario region geographic temperature clusters that could prove useful for biodiesel blend-related decision-making.},

	abstract = {Abstract. Gridded statistical downscaling methods are the main means of preparing climate model data to drive distributed hydrological models. Past work on the validation of climate downscaling methods has focused on temperature and precipitation, with less attention paid to the ultimate outputs from hydrological models. Also, as attention shifts towards projections of extreme events, downscaling comparisons now commonly assess methods in terms of climate extremes, but hydrologic extremes are less well explored. Here, we test the ability of gridded downscaling models to replicate historical properties of climate and hydrologic extremes, as measured in terms of temporal sequencing (i.e. correlation tests) and distributional properties (i.e. tests for equality of probability distributions). Outputs from seven downscaling methods – bias correction constructed analogues (BCCA), double BCCA (DBCCA), BCCA with quantile mapping reordering (BCCAQ), bias correction spatial disaggregation (BCSD), BCSD using minimum/maximum temperature (BCSDX), the climate imprint delta method (CI), and bias corrected CI (BCCI) – are used to drive the Variable Infiltration Capacity (VIC) model over the snow-dominated Peace River basin, British Columbia. Outputs are tested using split-sample validation on 26 climate extremes indices (ClimDEX) and two hydrologic extremes indices (3-day peak flow and 7-day peak flow). To characterize observational uncertainty, four atmospheric reanalyses are used as climate model surrogates and two gridded observational data sets are used as downscaling target data. The skill of the downscaling methods generally depended on reanalysis and gridded observational data set. However, CI failed to reproduce the distribution and BCSD and BCSDX the timing of winter 7-day low-flow events, regardless of reanalysis or observational data set. Overall, DBCCA passed the greatest number of tests for the ClimDEX indices, while BCCAQ, which is designed to more accurately resolve event-scale spatial gradients, passed the greatest number of tests for hydrologic extremes. Non-stationarity in the observational/reanalysis data sets complicated the evaluation of downscaling performance. Comparing temporal homogeneity and trends in climate indices and hydrological model outputs calculated from downscaled reanalyses and gridded observations was useful for diagnosing the reliability of the various historical data sets. We recommend that such analyses be conducted before such data are used to construct future hydro-climatic change scenarios.},

However, if the observations are of much higher resolution, quantile mapping also attempts to bridge this scale mismatch. Here, it is shown for daily precipitation that such quantile mapping–based downscaling is not feasible but introduces similar problems as inﬂation of perfect prognosis (‘‘prog’’) downscaling: the spatial and temporal structure of the corrected time series is misrepresented, the drizzle effect for area means is overcorrected, area-mean extremes are overestimated, and trends are affected.

	abstract = {Six approaches for downscaling climate model outputs for use in hydrologic simulation were evaluated, with particular emphasis on each method’s ability to produce precipitation and other variables used to drive a macroscale hydrology model applied at much higher spatial resolution than the climate model. Comparisons were made on the basis of a twenty-year retrospective (1975–1995) climate simulation produced by the NCAR-DOE Parallel Climate Model (PCM), and the implications of the comparison for a future (2040–2060) PCM climate scenario were also explored. The six approaches were made up of three relatively simple statistical downscaling methods – linear interpolation (LI), spatial disaggregation (SD), and bias-correction and spatial disaggregation (BCSD) – each applied to both PCM output directly (at T42 spatial resolution), and after dynamical downscaling via a Regional Climate Model (RCM – at 1/2-degree spatial resolution), for downscaling the climate model outputs to the 1/8-degree spatial resolution of the hydrological model. For the retrospective climate simulation, results were compared to an observed gridded climatology of temperature and precipitation, and gridded hydrologic variables resulting from forcing the hydrologic model with observations. The most signiﬁcant ﬁndings are that the BCSD method was successful in reproducing the main features of the observed hydrometeorology from the retrospective climate simulation, when applied to both PCM and RCM outputs. Linear interpolation produced better results using RCM output than PCM output, but both methods (PCM-LI and RCM-LI) lead to unacceptably biased hydrologic simulations. Spatial disaggregation of the PCM output produced results similar to those achieved with the RCM interpolated output; nonetheless, neither PCM nor RCM output was useful for hydrologic simulation purposes without a bias-correction step. For the future climate scenario, only the BCSD-method (using PCM or RCM) was able to produce hydrologically plausible results. With the BCSD method, the RCM-derived hydrology was more sensitive to climate change than the PCM-derived hydrology.},

	abstract = {The Canadian Earth System Model version 5 (CanESM5) is a global model developed to simulate historical climate change and variability, to make centennial-scale projections of future climate, and to produce initialized seasonal and decadal predictions. This paper describes the model components and their coupling, as well as various aspects of model development, including tuning, optimization, and a reproducibility strategy. We also document the stability of the model using a long control simulation, quantify the model's ability to reproduce large-scale features of the historical climate, and evaluate the response of the model to external forcing. CanESM5 is comprised of three-dimensional atmosphere (T63 spectral resolution equivalent roughly to 2.8∘) and ocean (nominally 1∘) general circulation models, a sea-ice model, a land surface scheme, and explicit land and ocean carbon cycle models. The model features relatively coarse resolution and high throughput, which facilitates the production of large ensembles. CanESM5 has a notably higher equilibrium climate sensitivity (5.6\&thinsp;K) than its predecessor, CanESM2 (3.7\&thinsp;K), which we briefly discuss, along with simulated changes over the historical period. CanESM5 simulations contribute to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 6 (CMIP6) and will be employed for climate science and service applications in Canada.},

	abstract = {A generalization of the single soil layer variable infiltration capacity (VIC) land surface hydrological model previously implemented in the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory general circulation model (GCM) is described. The new model is comprised of a two-layer characterization of the soil column, and uses an aerodynamic representation of the latent and sensible heat fluxes at the land surface. The infiltration algorithm for the upper layer is essentially the same as for the single layer VIC model, while the lower layer drainage formulation is of the form previously implemented in the Max-Planck-Institut GCM. The model partitions the area of interest (e.g., grid cell) into multiple land surface cover types; for each land cover type the fraction of roots in the upper and lower zone is specified. Evapotranspiration consists of three components: canopy evaporation, evaporation from bare soils, and transpiration, which is represented using a canopy and architectural resistance formulation. Once the latent heat flux has been computed, the surface energy balance is iterated to solve for the land surface temperature at each time step. The model was tested using long-term hydrologic and climatological data for Kings Creek, Kansas to estimate and validate the hydrological parameters, and surface flux data from three First International Satellite Land Surface Climatology Project Field Experiment intensive field campaigns in the summer-fall of 1987 to validate the surface energy fluxes.},

A brief review is given of the historical development of measurement theory. The model-theoretic definition of measurement is presented, together with a discussion of representation and uniqueness conditions. Nominal, ordinal, extensive and interval measurement structures are outlined. The classification of scale types and the problem of meaningfulness are considered. A survey is given of conjoint and derived measurement. A brief review is made of the applications of measurement theory. Consideration is given to the treatment of uncertainty. The setting-up of systems of scales of measurement for a domain of science and its relation to theories for that domain are discussed. It is argued that measurement as defined is related to other forms of symbolic representation such as is involved in computer data representation and natural language.},

	abstract = {The non-parametric Mann-Kendall (MK) statistical test has been popularly used to assess the signiﬁcance of trend in hydrological time series. The test requires sample data to be serially independent. When sample data are serially correlated, the presence of serial correlation in time series will affect the ability of the test to correctly assess the signiﬁcance of trend. To eliminate the effect of serial correlation on the MK test, effective sample size (ESS) has been proposed to modify the MK statistic. This study investigates the ability of ESS to eliminate the inﬂuence of serial correlation on the MK test by Monte Carlo simulation. Simulation demonstrates that when no trend exists within time series, ESS can effectively limit the effect of serial correlation on the MK test. When trend exists within time series, the existence of trend will contaminate the estimate of the magnitude of sample serial correlation, and ESS computed from the contaminated serial correlation cannot properly eliminate the effect of serial correlation on the MK test. However, if ESS is computed from the sample serial correlation that is estimated from the detrended series, ESS can still effectively reduce the inﬂuence of serial correlation on the MK test.},
